# Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was the crisis management model of Crisis Text Line. CTL volunteers help their users find personalized resources for their crises when asked. Since it can be hard to find exactly what you need when you need it, we decided that a good project would be to make a streamlined version of this process.

# What it does
Piece of Mind is a compilation of various mental health resources, as well as a quick survey user, can take in order to find what resources are best for them.

# How we built it
We built Piece of Mind using dynamic HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Github.

# Challenges we ran into
A problem we ran into was managing how to format the survey, and make it work smoothly for the user. We also wanted the page to have a popup when it was first opened, to display crisis lines front and center.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Weâ€™re proud of our ability to have compiled and sorted these resources for our users, and that the survey, while brief, can help narrow down exactly what the users need.

# What we learned
We learned a tremendous amount about CSS styling, how to incorporate Javascript to build back-end of a website

# What's next for Piece of Mind
In the future, we aim to improve the functionality of the website, as well as widen the scope of available resources.

# Built With
CSS, HTML, Javascript
